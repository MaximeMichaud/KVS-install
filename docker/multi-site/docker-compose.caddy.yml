# =============================================================================
# KVS Multi-Site - Caddy Reverse Proxy
# =============================================================================
#
# This is the central reverse proxy that handles:
# - SSL certificates (automatic Let's Encrypt)
# - Routing to individual KVS sites
# - HTTP to HTTPS redirect
#
# USAGE:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.caddy.yml up -d
#
# Each KVS site connects to the 'kvs-proxy' network and Caddy routes
# traffic based on the domain name.
